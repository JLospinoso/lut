== Lospi.net Utils ==
These utilities represent a collection of functionality requirements that crop up from time to time in numerical and statistical contexts. Some examples of current functionality:

* Deep copies of collections of objects, e.g. for task local storage
* Two key dictionaries that don't require you to declare extraneous Tuple keys
* Symmetric two key dictionaries that don't care about the ordering of the keys
* Sorting, scaling, standardizing, normalizing, percentile-izing of collections of doubles
* Standard deviations and variances for collections of doubles
* Drawing random elements from a dictionary representing a probability distribution

The operations on collections are implemented as extension methods for a fluent API.
